      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the first post of my new blog.  You may see old posts showing up behind
here, those have been pulled in from my personal blog at blog.natefinch.com.
I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to split off my programming posts so that people who only want to
see the coding stuff don&amp;rsquo;t have to see my personal posts, and people that only
want to see my personal stuff don&amp;rsquo;t have to get inundated with programming
posts.&lt;/p&gt;
