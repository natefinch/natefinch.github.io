      <title>To Enum or Not To Enum</title>
      <link>https://npf.io/2015/12/enums/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Enum-like values have come up in my reviews of other people&amp;rsquo;s code a few times, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to nail down what we feel is best practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen many places what in other languages would be an enum, i.e. a bounded list of known values that encompass every value that should ever exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code I have been critical of simply calls these values strings, and creates a few well-known values, thusly:
package tool&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;// types of tools
const (
    ScrewdriverType = &amp;ldquo;screwdriver&amp;rdquo;
    HammerType = &amp;ldquo;hammer&amp;rdquo;
   // &amp;hellip;
)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;type Tool struct {
    typ string
}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;func NewTool(tooltype string) (Tool, error) {
    switch tooltype{
        case ScrewdriverType, HammerType:
            return Tool{typ:tooltype}, nil
        default:
            return Tool{}, errors.New(&amp;ldquo;invalid type&amp;rdquo;)
    }
}
The problem with this is that there&amp;rsquo;s nothing stopping you from doing something totally wrong like this:
name := user.Name()&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;// &amp;hellip; some other stuff&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a := NewTool(name)
That would fail only at runtime, which kind of defeats the purpose of having a compiler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why we don&amp;rsquo;t at least define the tool type as a named type of string, i.e.
package tool&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;type ToolType string&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;const (
    Screwdriver ToolType = &amp;ldquo;screwdriver&amp;rdquo;
    Hammer = &amp;ldquo;hammer&amp;rdquo;
   // &amp;hellip;
)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;type Tool struct {
    typ ToolType
}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;func NewTool(tooltype ToolType) Tool {
        return Tool{typ:tooltype}
}
Note that now we can drop the error checking in NewTool because the compiler does it for us.  The ToolType still works in all ways like a string, so it&amp;rsquo;s trivial to convert for printing, serialization, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this still lets you do something which is wrong but might not always look wrong:
a := NewTool(&amp;ldquo;drill&amp;rdquo;)
Because of how Go constants work, this will get converted to a ToolType, even though it&amp;rsquo;s not one of the ones we have defined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final revision, which is the one I&amp;rsquo;d propose, removes even this possibility, by not using a string at all (it also uses a lot less memory and creates less garbage):
package tool&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;type ToolType int&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;const (
    Screwdriver ToolType = iota
    Hammer
   // &amp;hellip;
)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;type Tool struct {
    typ ToolType
}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;func NewTool(tooltype ToolType) Tool {
        return Tool{typ:tooltype}
}
This now prevents passing in a constant string that looks like it might be right. You can pass in a constant number, but NewTool(5) is a hell of a lot more obviously wrong than NewTool(&amp;ldquo;drill&amp;rdquo;), IMO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The push back I&amp;rsquo;ve heard about this is that then you have to manually write the String() function to make human-readable strings&amp;hellip; but there are code generators that already do this for you in extremely optimized ways (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/cmd/stringer/stringer.go&#34;&gt;https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/cmd/stringer/stringer.go&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Returning Errors</title>
      <link>https://npf.io/2015/10/errors/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 10 Oct 2015 00:00:19 EDT</pubDate>
      <author>Nate Finch</author>
      <guid>https://npf.io/2015/10/errors/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are basically two ways to return errors in Go:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-go&#34;&gt;func (c Config) Save() error {
	if err := c.checkDefault(); err != nil {
		return err
	}
	...
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-go&#34;&gt;func (c Config) Save() error {
	if err := c.checkDefault(); err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf(&amp;quot;can&#39;t find default config file: %v&amp;quot;, err)
	}
	...
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The former passes the original error up the stack, but adds no context to it.
Thus, your saveConfig function may end up printing &amp;ldquo;file not found:
default.cfg&amp;rdquo; without telling the caller why it was trying to open default.cfg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latter allows you to add context to an error, so the above error could
become &amp;ldquo;can&amp;rsquo;t find default config file: file not found: default.cfg&amp;rdquo;.
This gives nice context to the error, but unfortunately, it creates an entirely
new error that only maintains the error string from the original.  This is fine
for human-facing output, but is useless for error handling code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use the former code, calling code can then use &lt;code&gt;os.IsNotExist()&lt;/code&gt;, figure
out that it was a not found error, and create the file.  Using the latter code,
the type of the error is now a different type than the one from os.Open, and
thus will not return true from os.IsNotExist.  Using fmt.Errorf effectively
masks the original error from calling code (unless you do ugly string parsing -
please don&amp;rsquo;t).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s good to mask the original error, if you don&amp;rsquo;t want your callers
depending on what should be an implementation detail (thus effectively making it
part of your API contract). However, lots of times you may want to give your
callers the ability to introspect your errors and act on them. This then loses
the opportunity to add context to the error, and so people calling your code
have to do some mental gymnastics (and/or look at the implementation) to
understand what an error really means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further problem for both these cases is that when debuging, you lose all
knowledge of where an error came from.  There&amp;rsquo;s no stack trace, there&amp;rsquo;s not even
a file and line number of where the error originated.  This can make debugging
errors fairly difficult, unless you&amp;rsquo;re careful to make your error messages easy
to grep for.  I can&amp;rsquo;t tell you how often I&amp;rsquo;ve searched for an error formatting
string, and hoped I was guessing the format correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just the way it is in Go, so what&amp;rsquo;s a developer to do?  Why, write an
errors library that does smarter things of course!  And there are a ton of these
things out there.  Many add a stack trace at error creation time.  Most wrap an
original error in some way, so you can add some context while keeping the
original error for checks like os.IsNotExist. At Canonical, the Juju team wrote
just such a library (actually we wrote 3 and then had them fight until only one
was standing), and the result is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/juju/errors&#34;&gt;https://github.com/juju/errors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus you might return an error this way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-go&#34;&gt;func (c Config) Save() error {
	if err := c.checkDefault(); err != nil {
		return errors.Annotatef(err, &amp;quot;can&#39;t find default config file&amp;quot;)
	}
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This returns a new error created by the errors package which adds the given
string to the front of the original error&amp;rsquo;s error message (just like
fmt.Errorf), but you can introspect it using &lt;code&gt;errors.Cause(err)&lt;/code&gt; to access the
original error return by checkDefault.  Thus you can use
&lt;code&gt;os.IsNotExist(errors.Cause(err))&lt;/code&gt; and it&amp;rsquo;ll do the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this and every other special error library suffer from the same problem
- your library can only understand its own special errors.  And no one else&amp;rsquo;s
code can understand your errors (because they won&amp;rsquo;t know to use errors.Cause
before checking the error).  Now you&amp;rsquo;re back to square one - your errors are
just as opaque to third party code as if they were created by fmt.Errorf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t really have an answer to this problem. It&amp;rsquo;s inherent in the
functionality (or lack thereof) of the standard Go error type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, if you&amp;rsquo;re writing a standalone package for many other people to use,
don&amp;rsquo;t use a third party error wrapping library.  Your callers are likely not
going to be using the same library, so they won&amp;rsquo;t get use out of it, and it adds
unnecessary dependencies to your code.  To decide between returning the original
error and an annotated error using fmt.Errorf is harder.  It&amp;rsquo;s hard to know when
the information in the original error might be useful to your caller.  On the
other hand, the additional context added by fmt.Errorf can often change an
inscrutable error into an obvious one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re writing an application where you&amp;rsquo;ll be controlling most of the
packages being written, then an errors package may make sense&amp;hellip; but you still
run the risk of giving your custom errors to third party code that can&amp;rsquo;t
understand them.  Plus, any errors library adds some complexity to the code (for
example, you always have to rememeber to call &lt;code&gt;os.IsNotExist(errors.Cause(err))&lt;/code&gt;
rather than just calling &lt;code&gt;os.InNotExist(err)&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to choose one of the three options every time you return an error.
Choose carefully.  Sometimes you&amp;rsquo;re going to make a choice that makes your life
more difficult down the road.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Take control of your commands with Deputy</title>
      <link>https://npf.io/2015/06/deputy/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2015 12:44:29 EDT</pubDate>
      <author>Nate Finch</author>
      <guid>https://npf.io/2015/06/deputy/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3185864/8237448/6bc30102-15bd-11e5-9e87-6423197a73d6.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;deputy-sm&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;image: creative commons, &amp;copy; &lt;a href=&#34;http://matsurd.deviantart.com/art/Paper53-Deputy-Stubbs-342123485&#34;&gt;MatsuRD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a part of my work on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/juju/juju&#34;&gt;Juju&lt;/a&gt;, I have published a
new package at &lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/juju/deputy&#34;&gt;http://github.com/juju/deputy&lt;/a&gt;.  I think it&amp;rsquo;ll be of general use
to a lot of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;I want to name a package &amp;quot;lieutenant&amp;quot;, but it&amp;#39;s too hard to spell.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Nate Finch (@NateTheFinch) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/NateTheFinch/status/610481962311131136&#34;&gt;June 15, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True story.  The idea was this package would be a lieutenant commander (get
it?)&amp;hellip; but I also knew I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to have to try to spell lieutenant
correctly every time I used the package.  So that&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s called deputy.
He&amp;rsquo;s the guy who&amp;rsquo;s not in charge, but does all the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;errors&#34;&gt;Errors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/juju/juju&#34;&gt;Juju&lt;/a&gt;, we run a lot of external processes
using os/exec. However, the default functionality of an exec.Cmd object is kind
of lacking. The most obvious one is those error returns &amp;ldquo;exit status 1&amp;rdquo;.
Fantastic.  Have you ever wished you could just have the stderr from the command
as the error text?  Well, now you can, with deputy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;func main() {
    d := deputy.Deputy{
        Errors:    deputy.FromStderr,
    }
    cmd := exec.Command(&amp;quot;foo&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;bar&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;baz&amp;quot;)
    err := d.Run(cmd)
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above code, if the command run by Deputy exits with a non-zero exit
status, deputy will capture the text output to stderr and convert that into the
error text.  &lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt; if the command returned exit status 1 and output &amp;ldquo;Error: No
such image or container: bar&amp;rdquo; to stderr, then the error&amp;rsquo;s Error() text would
look like &amp;ldquo;exit status 1: Error: No such image or container: bar&amp;rdquo;.  Bam, the
errors from commands you run are infinitely more useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;logging&#34;&gt;Logging&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another idiom we use is to pipe some of the output from a command to our logs. This can be super useful for debugging purposes.  With deputy, this is again easy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;func main() {
    d := deputy.Deputy{
        Errors:    deputy.FromStderr,
        StdoutLog: func(b []byte) { log.Print(string(b)) },
    }
    cmd := exec.Command(&amp;quot;foo&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;bar&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;baz&amp;quot;)
    err := d.Run(cmd)
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it.  Now every line written to stdout by the process will be piped as a
log message to your log.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;timeouts&#34;&gt;Timeouts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, an idiom we don&amp;rsquo;t use often enough, but should, is to add a timeout to
command execution.  What happens if you run a command as part of your pipeline
and that command hangs for 30 seconds, or 30 minutes, or forever?  Do you just
assume it&amp;rsquo;ll always finish in a reasonable time?  Adding a timeout to running
commands requires some tricky coding with goroutines, channels, selects, and
killing the process&amp;hellip; and deputy wraps all that up for you in a simple API:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;func main() {
    d := deputy.Deputy{
        Errors:    deputy.FromStderr,
        StdoutLog: func(b []byte) { log.Print(string(b)) },
        Timeout:   time.Second * 10,
    }
    cmd := exec.Command(&amp;quot;foo&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;bar&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;baz&amp;quot;)
    err := d.Run(cmd)
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above code adds a 10 second timeout.  After that time, if the process has
not finished, it will be killed and an error returned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it.  Give deputy a spin and let me know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Testing os/exec.Command</title>
      <link>https://npf.io/2015/06/testing-exec-command/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 26 Jun 2015 06:41:56 EDT</pubDate>
      <author>Nate Finch</author>
      <guid>https://npf.io/2015/06/testing-exec-command/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/juju/juju&#34;&gt;Juju&lt;/a&gt;, we often have code that needs to run external
executables.  Testing this code is a nightmare&amp;hellip; because you really don&amp;rsquo;t want
to run those files on the dev&amp;rsquo;s machine or the CI machine.  But mocking out
os/exec is really hard.  There&amp;rsquo;s no interface to replace, there&amp;rsquo;s no function to
mock out and replace.  In the end, your code calls the Run method on the
exec.Cmd struct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of bad ways you can mock this out - you can write out scripts to
disk with the right name and structure their contents to write out the correct
data to stdout, stderr and return the right return code&amp;hellip; but then you&amp;rsquo;re
writing platform-specific code in your tests, which means you need a Windows
version and a Linux version&amp;hellip; It also means you&amp;rsquo;re writing shell scripts or
Windows batch files or whatever, instead of writing Go.  And we all know that we
want our tests to be in Go, not shell scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;rsquo;s the answer?  Well, it turns out, if you want to mock out exec.Command,
the best place to look is in the exec package&amp;rsquo;s tests themselves.  Lo and
behold, it&amp;rsquo;s right there in the first function of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/os/exec/exec_test.go#L31&#34;&gt;exec_test.go&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;func helperCommand(t *testing.T, s ...string) *exec.Cmd {
    cs := []string{&amp;quot;-test.run=TestHelperProcess&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;--&amp;quot;}
    cs = append(cs, s...)
    cmd := exec.Command(os.Args[0], cs...)
    cmd.Env = []string{&amp;quot;GO_WANT_HELPER_PROCESS=1&amp;quot;}
    return cmd
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(one line elided for clarity) &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the heck is that doing?  It&amp;rsquo;s pretty slick, so I&amp;rsquo;ll explain it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, you have to understand how tests in Go work.  When running &lt;code&gt;go test&lt;/code&gt;,
the go tool compiles an executable from your code, runs it, and passes it the
flags you passed to &lt;code&gt;go test&lt;/code&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s that executable which actually handles the
flags and runs the tests.  Thus, while your tests are running, os.Args[0] is the
name of the test executable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This function is making an exec.Command that runs the test executable, and
passes it the flag to tell the executable just to run a single test.  It then
terminates the argument list with &lt;code&gt;--&lt;/code&gt; and appends the command and arguments
that would have been given to exec.Command to run &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end result is that when you run the exec.Cmd that is returned, it will run
the single test from this package called &amp;ldquo;TestHelperProcess&amp;rdquo; and os.Args will
contain (after the &lt;code&gt;--&lt;/code&gt;) the command and arguments from the original call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The environment variable is there so that the test can know to do nothing unless
that environment variable is set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is awesome for a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s all Go code. No more needing to write shell scripts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The code run in the excutable is compiled with the rest of your test code.  No more needing to worry about typos in the strings you&amp;rsquo;re writing to disk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No need to create new files on disk - the executable is already there and runnable, by definition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let&amp;rsquo;s use this in a real example to make it more clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your production code, you can do something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var execCommand = exec.Command
func RunDocker(container string) ([]byte, error) {
    cmd := execCommand(&amp;quot;docker&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;run&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;-d&amp;quot;, container)
    out, err := cmd.CombinedOutput()
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mocking this out in test code is now super easy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;func fakeExecCommand(command string, args...string) *exec.Cmd {
    cs := []string{&amp;quot;-test.run=TestHelperProcess&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;--&amp;quot;, command}
    cs = append(cs, args...)
    cmd := exec.Command(os.Args[0], cs...)
    cmd.Env = []string{&amp;quot;GO_WANT_HELPER_PROCESS=1&amp;quot;}
    return cmd
}

const dockerRunResult = &amp;quot;foo!&amp;quot;
func TestRunDocker(t *testing.T) {
    execCommand = fakeExecCommand
    defer func(){ execCommand = exec.Command }()
    out, err := RunDocker(&amp;quot;docker/whalesay&amp;quot;)
    if err != nil {
        t.Errorf(&amp;quot;Expected nil error, got %#v&amp;quot;, err)
    }
    if string(out) != dockerRunResult {
        t.Errorf(&amp;quot;Expected %q, got %q&amp;quot;, dockerRunResult, out)
    }
}

func TestHelperProcess(t *testing.T){
    if os.GetEnv(&amp;quot;GO_WANT_HELPER_PROCESS&amp;quot;) != &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; {
        return
    }
    // some code here to check arguments perhaps?
    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stdout, dockerRunResult)
    os.Exit(0)
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, you can do a lot more interesting things. The environment variables
on the command that fakeExecCommand returns make a nice side channel for telling
the executable what you want it to do.  I use one to tell the process to exit
with a non-zero error code, which is great for testing your error handling code.
You can see how the standard library uses its TestHelperProcess test
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/os/exec/exec_test.go#L559&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this will help you avoid writing really gnarly testing code (or even worse,
not testing your code at all).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had a problem yesterday - I wanted to use the excellent godoc.org to show
coworkers the godoc for the feature I was working on.  However, the feature was
on a branch of the main code in Github, and &lt;code&gt;go get&lt;/code&gt; Does Not Work That Way™.
So, what to do?  Well, I figured out a hack to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gopkg.in&#34;&gt;https://gopkg.in&lt;/a&gt; is a super handy service that lets you point &lt;code&gt;go get&lt;/code&gt; at
branches of your repo named vN (e.g. v0, v1, etc).  It also happens to work on
tags.  So, we can leverage this to get godoc.org to render the godoc for our WIP
branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From your WIP branch, simply do&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git tag v0
git push myremote v0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This creates a lightweight tag that only affects your repo (not upstream from
whence you forked).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You now can point godoc at your branch by way of gopkg.in:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://godoc.org/gopkg.in/GithubUser/repo.v0&#34;&gt;https://godoc.org/gopkg.in/GithubUser/repo.v0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will tell godoc to &amp;lsquo;go get&amp;rsquo; your code from gopkg.in, and gopkg.in will
redirect the command to your v0 tag, which is currently on your branch.  Bam,
now you have godoc for your WIP branch on godoc.org.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, the tag can easily be removed (and reused if needed) thusly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git tag -d v0
git push myremote :refs/tags/v0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, there you go, go forth and share your godoc.  I find it&amp;rsquo;s a great way to get
feedback on architecture before I dive into the reeds of the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Go Plugins are as Easy as Pie</title>
      <link>https://npf.io/2015/05/pie/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 25 May 2015 22:44:32 EDT</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;When people hear that Go only supports static linking, one of the things they
eventually realize is that they can&amp;rsquo;t have traditional plugins via dlls/libs (in
compiled languages) or scripts (in interpreted languages).  However, that
doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that you can&amp;rsquo;t have plugins.  Some people suggest doing &amp;ldquo;compiled-
in&amp;rdquo; plugins - but to me, that&amp;rsquo;s not a plugin, that&amp;rsquo;s just code.  Some people
suggest just running sub processes and sending messages via their CLI, but that
runs into CLI parsing issues and requires runnnig a new process for every
request.  The last option people think of is using RPC to an external process,
which may also seem cumbersome, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;serving-up-some-pie&#34;&gt;Serving up some pie&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to introduce you to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/natefinch/pie&#34;&gt;https://github.com/natefinch/pie&lt;/a&gt; - this is a Go
package which contains a toolkit for writing plugins in Go.  It uses processes
external to the main program as the plugins, and communicates with them via RPC
over the plugin&amp;rsquo;s stdin and stout.  Having the plugin as an external process can
actually has several benefits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the plugin crashes, it won&amp;rsquo;t crash your process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The plugin is not in your process&amp;rsquo; memory space, so it can&amp;rsquo;t do anything nasty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The plugin can be written in any language, not just Go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this last point is actually the most valuable.  One of the nicest things
about Go applications is that they&amp;rsquo;re just copy-and-run.  No one even needs to
know they were written in Go.  With plugins as external processes, this remains
true.  People wanting to extend your application can do so in the language of
their choice, so long as it supports the codec your application has chosen for
RPC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that the communication occurs over stdin and stdout means that there is
no need to worry about negotiating ports, it&amp;rsquo;s easily cross platform compatible,
and it&amp;rsquo;s very secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;orthogonality&#34;&gt;Orthogonality&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pie is written to be a very simple set of functions that help you set up
communication between your process and a plugin process.  Once you make a couple
calls to pie, you then need to work out your own way to use the RPC connection
created.  Pie does not attempt to be an all-in-one plugin framework, though you
could certainly use it as the basis for one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-is-it-called-pie&#34;&gt;Why is it called pie?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because if you pronounce API like &amp;ldquo;a pie&amp;rdquo;, then all this consuming and serving
of APIs becomes a lot more palatable.  Also, pies are the ultimate pluggable
interface - depending on what&amp;rsquo;s inside, you can get dinner, dessert, a snack, or
even breakfast.  Plus, then I get to say that plugins in Go are as easy as&amp;hellip;
well, you know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to be using pie in one of my own side projects.  Take it out for a spin
in one of your projects and let me know what you think.  Happy eating!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Go Nitpicks</title>
      <link>https://npf.io/2014/10/go-nitpicks/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2014 06:17:21 EDT</pubDate>
      <author>Nate Finch</author>
      <guid>https://npf.io/2014/10/go-nitpicks/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I saw this tweet last night:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A code interview I like to ask:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;What would you change about &amp;lt;your favourite language&amp;gt;?&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Having nothing to say to that is a big strike.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; karlseguin (@karlseguin) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/karlseguin/status/526860386704695296&#34;&gt;October 27, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figured I&amp;rsquo;d answer it here about Go.  Luckily, Go is a very small language, so there&amp;rsquo;s not a lot of surface area to dislike. However, there&amp;rsquo;s definitely some things I wish were different. Most of these are nitpicks, thus the title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;1-bare-returns&#34;&gt;#1 Bare Returns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;func foo() (i int, err error) {
    i, err = strconv.ParseInt(&amp;quot;5&amp;quot;) 
    return // wha??
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all that Go promotes readable and immediately understandable code, this seems like a ridiculous outlier. The way it works is that if you don&amp;rsquo;t declare what the function is returning, it&amp;rsquo;ll return the values stored in the named return variables.  Which seems logical and handy, until you see a 100 line function with multiple branches and a single bare return at the bottom, with no idea what is actually getting returned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To all gophers out there: don&amp;rsquo;t use bare returns.  Ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;2-new&#34;&gt;#2 New&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;a := new(MyStruct)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New means &amp;ldquo;Create a zero value of the given type and return a pointer to it&amp;rdquo;.  It&amp;rsquo;s sorta like the C++ &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt;, which is probably why it exists.  The problem is that it&amp;rsquo;s nearly useless.  It&amp;rsquo;s mostly redundant with simply returning the address of a value thusly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;a := &amp;amp;MyStruct{}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above is a lot easier to read, it also gives you the ability to populate the value you&amp;rsquo;re constructing (if you wish).  The only time new is &amp;ldquo;useful&amp;rdquo; is if you want to initialize a pointer to a builtin (like a string or an int), because you can&amp;rsquo;t do this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;a := &amp;amp;int
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but you can do this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;a := new(int)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, you could always just do it in (&lt;em&gt;gasp&lt;/em&gt;) two lines:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;a := 0
b := &amp;amp;a
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To all the gophers out there: don&amp;rsquo;t use new. Always use &amp;amp;Foo{} with structs, maps, and slices. Use the two line version for numbers and strings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;3-close&#34;&gt;#3 Close&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The close built-in function closes a channel. If the channel is already closed, close will panic.  This pisses me off, because most of the time when I call close, I don&amp;rsquo;t actually care if it&amp;rsquo;s already closed.  I just want to ensure that it&amp;rsquo;s closed.  I&amp;rsquo;d much prefer if close returned a boolean that said whether or not it did anything, and then if &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; choose to panic, I can.  Or, you know, not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;4-there-is-no-4&#34;&gt;#4 There is no 4&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s basically it.  There&amp;rsquo;s some things I think are necessary evils, like &lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;panic&lt;/code&gt;.  There&amp;rsquo;s some things that are necessary ugliness, like the built-in functions &lt;code&gt;append&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;delete&lt;/code&gt;, etc.  I sorta wish &lt;code&gt;x := range foo&lt;/code&gt; returned the value in x and not the index, but I get that it&amp;rsquo;s to be consistent between maps and slices, and returning the value in maps would be odd, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these are even below the level of nitpicks, though.  They don&amp;rsquo;t bug me, really.  I understand that everything in programming is a tradeoff, and I think the decisions made for Go were the right ones in these cases.  Sometimes you need goto.  Sometimes you need to panic.  Making those functions built-ins rather than methods on the types means you don&amp;rsquo;t need any methods on the types, which keeps them simpler, and means they&amp;rsquo;re &amp;ldquo;just data&amp;rdquo;.  It also means you don&amp;rsquo;t lose any functionality if you make new named types based on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;rsquo;s my list for Go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;postscript&#34;&gt;Postscript&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone on the twitter discussion mentioned he couldn&amp;rsquo;t think of anything he disliked about C#, which just about made me spit my coffee across the room.  I programmed in C# for ~9 years, starting out porting some 1.1 code to 2.0, and leaving as 5.0 came out.  The list of features in C# as of 5.0 is gigantic.  Even being a developer writing in it 40+ hours a week for 9 years, there was still stuff I had to look up to remember how it worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like my mastery of Go after a year of side projects was about equivalent to my mastery of C# after 9 years of full time development.  If we assume 1:1 correlation between time to master and size of the language, an order of magnitude sounds about right.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Everyone Hates Go</title>
      <link>https://npf.io/2014/10/why-everyone-hates-go/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2014 10:46:28 EDT</pubDate>
      <author>Nate Finch</author>
      <guid>https://npf.io/2014/10/why-everyone-hates-go/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Obviously, not &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; hates Go.  But there was a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Go-seem-to-be-the-most-heavily-
criticised-among-the-newer-programming-languages?srid=uCiY&amp;amp;share=1&#34;&gt;quora
question&lt;/a&gt; recently
about why everyone criticizes Go so much. (sorry, I don&amp;rsquo;t normally post links to
Quora, but it was the motivator for this post) Even before I saw the answers to
the question, I knew what they&amp;rsquo;d consist of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go is a language stuck in the 70&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go ignores 40 years of programming language research.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go is a language for blue collar (mediocre) developers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gophers are ok with working in Java 1.0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the answers to the questions were more concerned with explaining
why Go is &amp;ldquo;bad&amp;rdquo;, rather than why this gets under so many people&amp;rsquo;s skin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When reading the answers I had a eureka moment, and I realized why it is. So
here&amp;rsquo;s my answer to the same question. This is why Go is so heavily criticized,
not why Go is &amp;ldquo;bad&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s two awesome posts that inform my answer: Paul Graham&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; about keeping your identity
small, and Kathy Sierra&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://seriouspony.com/trouble-at-the-koolaid-
point&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; about the Koolaid point. I encourage you to read those two posts, as
they&amp;rsquo;re both very informative.  I hesitate to compare the horrific things that
happen to women online with the pedantry of flamewars about programming
languages, but the Koolaid Point is such a valid metaphor that I wanted to link
to the article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul says&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;people can never have a fruitful argument about
something that&amp;rsquo;s part of their identity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt; the subject hits too close to home,
and their response becomes emotional rather than logical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kathy says&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the hate wasn’t so much about the product/brand but that &lt;em&gt;other people were falling for it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt; they&amp;rsquo;d drunk the kool-aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go is the only recent language that takes the aforementioned 40 years of
programming language research and tosses it out the window. Other new languages
at least try to keep up with the Jones - Clojure, Scala, Rust - all try to
incorporate &amp;ldquo;modern programming theory&amp;rdquo; into their design. Go actively tries
not to. There is no pattern matching, there&amp;rsquo;s no borrowing, there&amp;rsquo;s no pure
functional programming, there&amp;rsquo;s no immutable variables, there&amp;rsquo;s no option types,
there&amp;rsquo;s no exceptions, there&amp;rsquo;s no classes, there&amp;rsquo;s no generics&amp;hellip;. there&amp;rsquo;s a lot
Go doesn&amp;rsquo;t have. And in the beginning this was enough to merely earn it scorn.
Even I am guilty of this. When I first heard about Go, I thought &amp;ldquo;What? No
exceptions? Pass.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then something happened - people started &lt;em&gt;using&lt;/em&gt; it. And liking it. And
building big projects with it. This is the Koolaid-point - where people have
started to drink the Koolaid and get fooled into thinking Go is a good
language. And this is where the scorn turns into derision and attacks on the
character of the people using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most vocal Go detractors are those developers who write in ML-derived
languages (Haskell, Rust, Scala, &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;) who have tied their preferred
programming language into their identity. The mere existence of Go says
&amp;ldquo;your views on what makes a good programming language are wrong&amp;rdquo;. And the more
people that use and like Go, the more strongly they feel that they&amp;rsquo;re being told
their choice of programming language - and therefore their identity - is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that basically no one in the Go community actually says this. But the Go
philosophy of simplicity and pragmatism above all else is the polar opposite of
what those languages espouse (in which complexity in the language is ok because
it enforces correctness in the code). This is insulting to the people who tie
their identity to that language. Whenever a post on Go makes it to the front
page of Hacker News, it is an affront to everything they hold dear, and so you
get comments like Go developers are stuck in the 70&amp;rsquo;s, or is only for blue-collar devs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, this is why I think people are so much more vocal about their dislike of Go:
because it challenges their identity, and other people are falling for it. This
is also why these posts so often mention Google and how the language would have
died without them. Google is now the koolaid dispenser. The fact that they
are otherwise generally thought of as a very talented pool of developers means
that it is simultaneously more outrageous that they are fooling people and more
insulting that their language flies in the face of ML-derived languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt;  I removed the &amp;ldquo;panties in a bunch&amp;rdquo; comment, since I was (correctly)
scolded for being sexist, not to mention unprofessional.  My apologies to
anyone I offended.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Deploy Discourse with Juju in 8 minutes</title>
      <link>https://npf.io/2014/10/deploy-discourse-juju/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2014 06:31:49 EDT</pubDate>
      <author>Nate Finch</author>
      <guid>https://npf.io/2014/10/deploy-discourse-juju/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://stevefrancia.com/&#34;&gt;Steve Francia&lt;/a&gt; asked me to help him get
&lt;a href=&#34;https://discourse.org&#34;&gt;Discourse&lt;/a&gt; deployed as a place for people to discuss
&lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;, his static site generator (which is what I use to
build this blog).  If you don&amp;rsquo;t know Discourse, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty amazing forum
software with community-driven moderation, all the modern features you expect
(@mentions, SSO integration, deep email integration, realtime async updates, and
a whole lot more).  What I ended up deploying is now at
&lt;a href=&#34;http://discuss.gohugo.io&#34;&gt;discuss.gohugo.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d already played around with deploying Discourse about six months ago, so I
already had an idea of what was involved.  Given that I work on
&lt;a href=&#34;http://juju.ubuntu.com&#34;&gt;Juju&lt;/a&gt; as my day job, of course I decided to use Juju to
deploy Discourse for Steve.  This involved writing a Juju &lt;em&gt;charm&lt;/em&gt; which is sort
of like an install script, but with hooks for updating configuration and hooks
for interacting with other services. I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about the process of writing the
charm in a later post, but for now, all you need to know is that it follows the
official &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/docs/INSTALL-digital-ocean.md&#34;&gt;install guide&lt;/a&gt; for installing Discourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The install guide says that you can install Discourse in 30 minutes.  Following
it took me a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; longer than that, due to some confusion about what the
install guide really wanted you to do, and what the install really required.
But you don&amp;rsquo;t need to know any of that to use Juju to install Discourse, and you
can get it done in 8 minutes, not 30.  Here&amp;rsquo;s how:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, install Juju:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:juju/stable
sudo apt-get update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt-get install -y juju-core
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, Juju does not yet have a provider for Digital Ocean, so we have to use a
plugin to get the machine created.  We&amp;rsquo;re in the process of writing a provider
for Digital Ocean, so soon the plugin won&amp;rsquo;t be necessary.  If you use another
cloud provider, such as AWS, Azure, HP Cloud, Joyent, or run your own Openstack
or MAAS, you can easily &lt;a href=&#34;https://juju.ubuntu.com/docs/getting-a
started.html#configuring&#34;&gt;configure Juju&lt;/a&gt; to use that service, and a couple of these steps will
not be necessary.  I&amp;rsquo;ll post separate steps for that later.  But for now, let&amp;rsquo;s
assume you&amp;rsquo;re using Digital Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install the juju &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kapilt/juju-digitalocean&#34;&gt;Digital Ocean plugin&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install -y python-pip
pip install -U juju-docean
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get your Digital Ocean &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.digitalocean.com/api_access&#34;&gt;access info&lt;/a&gt;
and set the client id in an environment variable called DO_CLIENT_ID and the API
key in an environment variable called DO_API_KEY.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Juju requires access with an SSH key to the machines, so make sure you have one
set up in your Digital Ocean account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let&amp;rsquo;s create a simple configuration so juju knows where you want to deploy
your new environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;juju init
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running juju init will create a boilerplate configuration file at
~/.juju/environments.yaml.  We&amp;rsquo;ll append our digital ocean config at the bottom:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;echo &amp;quot;    digitalocean:
        type: manual
        bootstrap-host: null
        bootstrap-user: root
&amp;quot; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ~/.juju/environments.yaml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that this is yaml, so the spaces at the beginning of each line are
important.  Copy and paste should do the right thing, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we can start the real fun, let&amp;rsquo;s switch to the digitalocean environment we
just configured, and create the first Juju machine in Digital Ocean:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;juju switch digitalocean
juju docean bootstrap --constraints=&amp;quot;mem=2g, region=nyc2&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(obviously replace the region with whatever one you want)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it&amp;rsquo;ll take about a minute for the machine to come up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discourse &lt;em&gt;requires&lt;/em&gt; email to function, so you need an account at
&lt;a href=&#34;http://mandrill.com&#34;&gt;mandrill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://mailgun.com&#34;&gt;mailgun&lt;/a&gt;, etc.  They&amp;rsquo;re free, so
don&amp;rsquo;t worry.  From that account you need to get some information to properly set
up Discourse.  You can do this after installing discourse, but it&amp;rsquo;s faster if
you do it before and give the configuration at deploy time. (changing settings
later will take a couple minutes while discourse reconfigures itself)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you deploy discourse, you&amp;rsquo;re going to give it a configuration file, which
will look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;discourse:
  DISCOURSE_HOSTNAME: discuss.example.com
  DISCOURSE_DEVELOPER_EMAILS: foo@example.com,bar@example.com
  DISCOURSE_SMTP_ADDRESS: smtp.mailservice.com
  DISCOURSE_SMTP_PORT: 587
  DISCOURSE_SMTP_USER_NAME: postmaster@example.com
  DISCOURSE_SMTP_PASSWORD: supersecretpassword
  UNICORN_WORKERS: 3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first line must be the same as the name of the service you&amp;rsquo;re deploying.  By
default it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;discourse&amp;rdquo;, so you don&amp;rsquo;t need to change it unless you&amp;rsquo;re deploying
multiple copies of discourse to the same Juju environment.  And remember, this
is yaml, so those spaces at the beginning of the rest of the lines are
important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest should be pretty obvious.  Hostname is the domain name where your site
will be hosted.  This is important, because discourse will send account
activation emails, and the links will use that hostname.  Developer emails are
the email addresses of accounts that should get automatically promoted to admin
when created.  The rest is email-related stuff from your mail service account.
Finally, unicorn workers should just stay 3 unless you&amp;rsquo;re deploying to a machine
with less than 2GB of RAM, in which case set it to 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, so now that you have this file somewhere on disk, we can deploy discourse.
Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, it&amp;rsquo;s really easy.  Just do this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;juju deploy cs:~natefinch/trusty/discourse --config path/to/configfile --to 0
juju expose discourse
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it. If you&amp;rsquo;re deploying to a 2GB Digital Ocean droplet, it&amp;rsquo;ll take about
7 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To check on the status of the charm deployment, you can do &lt;code&gt;juju status&lt;/code&gt;, which
will show, among other things &amp;ldquo;agent-state: pending&amp;rdquo; while the charm is being
deployed.  Or, if you want to watch the logs roll by, you can do &lt;code&gt;juju debug-
log&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually juju status will show &lt;code&gt;agent-state: started&lt;/code&gt;.  Now grab the ip
address listed at &lt;code&gt;public address:&lt;/code&gt; in the same output and drop that into your
browser.  Bam!  Welcome to Discourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you ever need to change the configuration you set in the config file above,
you can do that by editing the file and doing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;juju set discourse --config=/path/to/config
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, if you just want to tweak a few values, you can do&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;juju set discourse foo=bar baz=bat ...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that every time you call juju set, it&amp;rsquo;ll take a couple minutes for
Discourse to reconfigure itself, so you don&amp;rsquo;t want to be doing this over and
over if you can hep it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you&amp;rsquo;re on your own, and will have to consult the gurus at
&lt;a href=&#34;discourse.org&#34;&gt;discourse.org&lt;/a&gt; if you have any problems.  But don&amp;rsquo;t worry, since
you deployed using Juju, which uses their official install instructions, your
discourse install is just like the ones people deploy manually (albeit with a
lot less time and trouble).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good Luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please let me know if you find any errors in this page, and I will fix them
immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TOML stands for Tom&amp;rsquo;s Own Minimal Language.  It is a configuration language
vaguely similar to YAML or property lists, but far, far better.  But before we
get into it in detail, let&amp;rsquo;s look back at what came before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;long-ago-in-a-galaxy-far-far-away&#34;&gt;Long Ago, In A Galaxy Far, Far Away&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of computing, people have needed a way to configure
their software.  On Linux, this generally is done in text files.  For simple
configurations, good old foo = bar works pretty well.  One setting per line,
name on the left, value on the right, separated by an equals.  Great.  But when
your configuration gets more complicated, this quickly breaks down.  What if you
need a value that is more than one line?  How do you indicate a value should be
parsed as a number instead of a string?  How do you namespace related
configuration values so you don&amp;rsquo;t need ridiculously long names to prevent
collisions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-dark-ages&#34;&gt;The Dark Ages&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 90&amp;rsquo;s, we used XML.  And it sucked.  XML is verbose, it&amp;rsquo;s hard for humans
to read and write, and it still doesn&amp;rsquo;t solve a lot of the problems above (like
how to specify the type of a value).  In addition, the XML spec is huge,
processing is very complicated, and all the extra features invite abuse and
overcomplication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;enlightenment&#34;&gt;Enlightenment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mid 2000&amp;rsquo;s, JSON came to popularity as a data exchange format, and it was
so much better than XML.  It had real types, it was easy for programs to
process, and you didn&amp;rsquo;t have to write a spec on what values should get processed
in what way (well, mostly).  It was sigificantly less verbose than XML.  But it
is a format intended for computers to read and write, not humans.  It is a pain
to write by hand, and even pretty-printed, it can be hard to read and the
compact data format turns into a nested mess of curly braces.  Also, JSON is not
without its problems&amp;hellip; for example, there&amp;rsquo;s no date type, there&amp;rsquo;s no support
for comments, and all numbers are floats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-false-start&#34;&gt;A False Start&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YAML came to popularity some time after JSON as a more human-readable format,
and its &lt;code&gt;key: value&lt;/code&gt; syntax and pretty indentation is definitely a lot easier on
the eyes than JSON&amp;rsquo;s nested curly-braces.  However, YAML trades ease of reading
for difficulty in writing.  Indentation as delimiters is fraught with error&amp;hellip;
figuring out how to get multiple lines of data into any random value is an
exercise in googling and trial &amp;amp; error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The YAML spec is also ridiculously long.  100% compatible parsers are very
difficult to write.  Writing YAML by hand is a ridden with landmines of corner
cases where your choice of names or values happens to hit a reserved word or
special marker.  It does support comments, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-savior&#34;&gt;The Savior&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On February 23, 2013, Tom Preston-Werner (former CEO of GitHub) made his first
commit to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/toml-lang/toml&#34;&gt;https://github.com/toml-lang/toml&lt;/a&gt;.  TOML stands for Tom&amp;rsquo;s Obvious,
Minimal Language.  It is a language designed for configuring software.  Finally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TOML takes inspiration from all of the above (well, except XML) and even gets
some of its syntax from Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s INI files.  It is easy to write by hand and
easy to read.  The spec is short and understandable by mere humans, and it&amp;rsquo;s
fairly easy for computers to parse.  It supports comments, has first class
dates, and supports both integers and floats.  It is generally insensitive to
whitespace, without requiring a ton of delimiters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s dive in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-basics&#34;&gt;The Basics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic form is key = value&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Comments start with hash
foo = &amp;quot;strings are in quotes and are always UTF8 with escape codes: \n \u00E9&amp;quot;

bar = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;multi-line strings
use three quotes&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;

baz = &#39;literal\strings\use\single\quotes&#39;

bat = &#39;&#39;&#39;multiline\literals\use
three\quotes&#39;&#39;&#39;

int = 5 # integers are just numbers
float = 5.0 # floats have a decimal point with numbers on both sides

date = 2006-05-27T07:32:00Z # dates are ISO 8601 full zulu form

bool = true # good old true and false
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One cool point:  If the first line of a multiline string (either literal or not)
is a line return, it will be trimmed.  So you can make your big blocks of text
start on the line after the name of the value and not need to worry about the
extraneous newline at the beginning of your text:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;preabmle = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union,
establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense,
promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves
and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United
States of America.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;lists&#34;&gt;Lists&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lists (arrays) are signified with brackets and delimited with commas.  Only
primitives are allowed in this form, though you may have nested lists.  The
format is forgiving, ignoring whitespace and newlines, and yes, the last comma
is optional (thank you!):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;foo = [ &amp;quot;bar&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;baz&amp;quot;
        &amp;quot;bat&amp;quot;
]

nums = [ 1, 2, ]

nested = [[ &amp;quot;a&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;b&amp;quot;], [1, 2]]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love that the format is forgiving of whitespace and that last comma.  I like
that the arrays are all of a single type, but allowing mixed types of sub-arrays
bugs the heck out of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;now-we-get-crazy&#34;&gt;Now we get crazy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s left?  In JSON there are objects, in YAML there are associative arrays&amp;hellip;
in common parlance they are maps or dictionaries or hash tables.  Named
collections of key/value pairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In TOML they are called tables and look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# some config above
[table_name]
foo = 1
bar = 2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foo and bar are keys in the table called table_name.  Tables have to be at the
end of the config file. Why?  because there&amp;rsquo;s no end delimiter.  All keys under
a table declaration are associated with that table, until a new table is
declared or the end of the file.  So declaring two tables looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# some config above
[table1]
foo = 1
bar = 2

[table2]
	foo = 1
	baz = 2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The declaration of table2 defines where table1 ends.  Note that you can indent
the values if you want, or not.  TOML doesn&amp;rsquo;t care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want nested tables, you can do that, too.  It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[table1]
	foo = &amp;quot;bar&amp;quot;

[table1.nested_table]
	baz = &amp;quot;bat&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;nested_table&lt;/code&gt; is defined as a value in &lt;code&gt;table1&lt;/code&gt; because its name starts with
&lt;code&gt;table1.&lt;/code&gt;.  Again, the table goes until the next table definition, so &lt;code&gt;baz=&amp;quot;bat&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;
is a value in &lt;code&gt;table1.nested_table&lt;/code&gt;.  You can indent the nested table to make it
more obvious, but again, all whitespace is optional:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[table1]
	foo = &amp;quot;bar&amp;quot;

	[table1.nested_table]
		baz = &amp;quot;bat&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is equivalent to the JSON:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{ 
	&amp;quot;table1&amp;quot; : {
		&amp;quot;foo&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;bar&amp;quot;,
		&amp;quot;nested_table&amp;quot; : {
			&amp;quot;baz&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;bat&amp;quot;
		}
	}
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having to retype the parent table name for each sub-table is kind of annoying,
but I do like that it is very explicit.  It also means that ordering and
indenting and delimiters don&amp;rsquo;t matter.  You don&amp;rsquo;t have to declare parent tables
if they&amp;rsquo;re empty, so you can do something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[foo.bar.baz]
bat = &amp;quot;hi&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is the equivalent to this JSON:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
	&amp;quot;foo&amp;quot; : {
		&amp;quot;bar&amp;quot; : {
			&amp;quot;baz&amp;quot; : {
				&amp;quot;bat&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;hi&amp;quot;
			}
		}
	}
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;last-but-not-least&#34;&gt;Last but not least&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last thing is arrays of tables, which are declared with double brackets
thusly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[[comments]]
author = &amp;quot;Nate&amp;quot;
text = &amp;quot;Great Article!&amp;quot;

[[comments]]
author = &amp;quot;Anonymous&amp;quot;
text = &amp;quot;Love it!&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is equivalent to the JSON:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
	&amp;quot;comments&amp;quot; : [
		{
			&amp;quot;author&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;Nate&amp;quot;,
			&amp;quot;text&amp;quot; : Great Article!&amp;quot;
		},
		{
			&amp;quot;author&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;Anonymous&amp;quot;,
			&amp;quot;text&amp;quot; : Love It!&amp;quot;
		}
	]
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arrays of tables inside another table get combined in the way you&amp;rsquo;d expect, like
[[table1.array]].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TOML is very permissive here. Because all tables have very explicitly defined
parentage, the order they&amp;rsquo;re defined in doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. You can have tables (and
entries in an array of tables) in whatever order you want.  This is totally
acceptable:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[[comments]]
author = &amp;quot;Anonymous&amp;quot;
text = &amp;quot;Love it!&amp;quot;

[foo.bar.baz]
bat = &amp;quot;hi&amp;quot;

[foo.bar]
howdy = &amp;quot;neighbor&amp;quot;

[[comments]]
author = &amp;quot;Anonymous&amp;quot;
text = &amp;quot;Love it!&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it generally makes sense to actually order things in a more organized
fashion, but it&amp;rsquo;s nice that you can&amp;rsquo;t shoot yourself in the foot if you reorder
things &amp;ldquo;incorrectly&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s TOML.  It&amp;rsquo;s pretty awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/toml-lang/toml#implementations&#34;&gt;list of parsers&lt;/a&gt;
on the TOML page on github for pretty much whatever language you want.  I
recommend &lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/BurntSushi/toml&#34;&gt;BurntSushi&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s for Go, since it
works just like the built-in parsers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is now my default configuration language for all the applications I write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next time you write an application that needs some configuration, take a
look at TOML.  I think your users will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
